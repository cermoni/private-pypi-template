# Overview

Timetable defines departure times of a vehicle for a given route. It is usually arranged based on hourly intervals. Optimization of a timetable means to maximize service levels for a given route based on maximum loads of routes, while aiming the load level. The algorithm takes max hourly loads and desired loads which is defined as a target level of bus loads and aims to satisfy this level awhile considering the total resources. The Algorithm aims to efficiently manage vehicle schedules to reduce operational costs and improve service quality. The main components of this project include:

1. **My Library**: My Library optimization algorithms
2. **First Process**: Merges first process
3. **Second Process**: Calculates second process

The project is designed to handle library problem based on card data available to ensure optimal performance.
